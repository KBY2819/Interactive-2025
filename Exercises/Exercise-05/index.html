        Four men walk under London’s sun.
        Crossin’ the lines, cool and free,
        A moment frozen, history. 
        Barefoot strides and suits so neat,
        Black and white beneath their feet.
        Through the city, through the sound,
        This road’s forever Abbey-bound. 
        Cars stand still, the world takes note,
        A single shot, a lasting quote.
        Side by side, they march in time,
        Timeless legends in their prime." />
