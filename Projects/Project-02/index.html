                                    Miles Davis’ "So What" from Kind of Blue is the definitive example of modal jazz, built around a relaxed yet deeply swinging groove that highlights space, tone, and feel. The rhythm section, led by Paul Chambers' iconic bassline, sets a cool and understated foundation that allows the horns to breathe and stretch out melodically. Davis' solo is sparse yet powerful, using phrasing that feels effortless and intentional, emphasizing mood over complexity. The arrangement revolves around a two-chord structure, creating a hypnotic, open-ended soundscape that lets each musician shape their improvisation with clarity and ease. "So What" captures the essence of cool jazz—minimal, melodic, and timeless.
